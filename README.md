# Clicky-Game 

# Built with React

* A game of memory where you have to click different images of "Programming languages" without repeating the same image, you think you can win??

## Getting Started

## Rules of the Game
This is a pretty straightforward memory challenge game. Click on an image only once. Each time you click an image, and it hasn't been clicked before, your score will go up by one point. If you click on an image more than once, that round is over. If you beat the high score, you take the lead! To make things interesting, every time you click an image, all of the images will be randomly shuffled. Good luck!

## Contributing to development
## Prerequisites
* Node installed on your local machine

## Installing
Follow the instructions in this section to get the app setup to run on your machine.

Clone the git project to your machine (example below is using ssh)

Install the node module dependencies from the package.json file

npm install

## Deploying to Github Pages
If you want to deploy a production version to Github Pages, there is a gh-pages package installed as part of the package.json packages that will help with that deploy. Follow the steps below:

Update the package.json file and change the "homepage" entry

Update the URL to your project site on Github Pages

"homepage": "https://jm27.github.io/react-clicky-game/",
Run the command to use gh-pages to deploy to the Github Pages site

npm run deploy
This will run the deploy script from the package.json file which will build the react app and then push it to Github Pages.
This will publish it based on the homepage url.
